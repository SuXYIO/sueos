# SueOS

## Intro

Just a regular **hand-made OS dream**, not finished yet.

Yeah, so I dreamed about making an _OS_ from scratch like literally every other bored programmer (honestly, I'm just a beginner) who admires the good old days of _machine code_ and _assembly_ dominating the programming world, where everyone could be a **legend**.  
Of course, it's only for learning purposes, and since I'm a _student_, the development won't be fast.  
It'd be a **miracle** even finishing this stuff _TBH_.

## Installation

Nah, won't be expecting installation in this project for the next few years.

## Devtools

- `nasm` for assembling
- `gcc` like, duh. You won't be writing an OS from `Java`, are you?
- `bochs` for emulation and debugging. `VirtualBox`'ll probably be a backup option.
